                	<h1>G. Keith Cambron: How The Internet Works</h1>
                    <div class="left">
                    	<p>In the space of 30 years the Internet went from a novelty used by engineers to become a part of our lives as essential as transportation. A third of the world's people use it and it has spread to virtually every country on earth. This three hour course explores the networks and technologies that work in concert to provide the wide range of services offered on the Internet. The course is organized into four fifteen minute videos per hour. Each video is accompanied by a self-exam of ten multiple choice questions.  There are no prerequisites, but students should have experience using the Internet and an interest in learning more about the technologies that enable it. Students who pass the course will gain a better understanding of how the networks are interconnected, how the Internet is organized and how it operates.</p>

                    <p>The Internet is not a single network, but rather a federation of tens of thousands of network operators interconnected using common standards for communication, addressing and operation. This hour introduces the Internet and key protocols like IP and TCP.</p>
                    <h2><a href="#">Night 2</a> Local Area Networks (LANs) and Wide Area Networks (WANs)</h2> <!--link to night 2-->
                    <p>This hour introduces Local Area Networks (LANs) and shows how they are connected to Wide Area Networks (WANs) to form the Internet.  It also describes how WANs interconnect, how web site addresses like google.com are translated into routable addresses and how they are accessed.</p>
                    <h2><a href="#">Night 3</a> Services and Operation</h2> <!--link to night 3-->
                    <p>Delivery of voice and video over the Internet rely on end to end services and protocols. This hour explores how those services work and shows how a remarkably reliable network is composed of unreliable systems.  As the successor to the current Internet protocol (IPv4), IPv6 is described as well as the process of transition.</p><br /><br />
