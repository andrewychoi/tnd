                        <p>In the space of 30 years the Internet went from a novelty used by engineers to become a part of our lives as essential as transportation. A third of the world's people use it and it has spread to virtually every country on earth. This three hour course explores the networks and technologies that work in concert to provide the wide range of services offered on the Internet. The course is organized into four fifteen minute videos per hour. Each video is accompanied by a self-exam of ten multiple choice questions. There are no prerequisites, but students should have experience using the Internet and an interest in learning more about the technologies that enable it. Students who pass the course will gain a better understanding of how the networks are interconnected, how the Internet is organized and how it operates.</p>

                        <p>Digital Subscriber Lines (DSL) is today the dominant global form of broadband access and the underlying enabling technology of the internet as we know it today, although many may not be aware of this quiet but solid internet base.  This 3-night stand will review DSL at its inception to its present dominant position on nearly Â½ billion phone lines and billions of off-loading wireless data of smarthphones and tablets that use DSL daily. In so doing, the short course explain the key basic technologies as DSL progressed from replacing voiceband modems with 10x their bandwidth in the mid 1990's, allowing the worldwide web to flourish (from its disappointing "World Wide Wait" status) into the medium we all use regularly today enabling many powerful new applications from web surfing to video/voice conferencing worldwide to IPTV and other forms of video to an essential component of todays mobile data successes. This continuing success required a number of fundamental technological innovations so that the existing wired and wireless infrastructure could economically keep pace with consumer's insatiable need for more and more digital data.  Speeds of initially 1 Mbps to 10's of Mbps and now to 100's of Mbps make it the fastest broadband medium per user (noting cable, fiber, and pure wireless share many customers so their per-user bandwidths are often misquoted).  As wireless data needs increase, perhaps driven increasingly by machines and things along with people, more recent technological innovations will also be cited that will continue DSL's growth over the next decades.</p>

                       <p>The U.S. government has committed itself to universal broadband service availability and high customer adoption rates. This short course will focus on three basic questions whose answers are critical to developing effective government policy: (1)What is the definition of universal broadband service? (2)Where are we now? (3)How do we reach the goal? The answer to each question is controversial. This course will focus on key market developments, regulatory history and recent government proposals that will help the viewer develop informed opinions on the broadband debate. A deeper goal is to develop a framework for evaluating other government policy issues. As you will see, the broadband debate is a microcosm of the fiscal debates in Washington (e.g. role of government, type of regulation needed, who pays and how much). No prerequisites are necessary for the course. A basic knowledge of economics would be helpful but not required. All technical terms taken from network design and economic theory will be explained by the presenter.
