                    <p>The Internet is not a single network, but rather a federation of tens of thousands of network operators interconnected using common standards for communication, addressing and operation. This hour introduces the Internet and key protocols like IP and TCP.</p>
                    <h2><a href="#">Night 2</a> Local Area Networks (LANs) and Wide Area Networks (WANs)</h2> <!--link to night 2-->
                    <p>This hour introduces Local Area Networks (LANs) and shows how they are connected to Wide Area Networks (WANs) to form the Internet.  It also describes how WANs interconnect, how web site addresses like google.com are translated into routable addresses and how they are accessed.</p>
                    <h2><a href="#">Night 3</a> Services and Operation</h2> <!--link to night 3-->
                    <p>Delivery of voice and video over the Internet rely on end to end services and protocols. This hour explores how those services work and shows how a remarkably reliable network is composed of unreliable systems.  As the successor to the current Internet protocol (IPv4), IPv6 is described as well as the process of transition.</p><br /><br />
